# Snack Overflow

## About The Team

Snack Overflow was formed for [Athena Hackathon 2022](https://www.showcode.io/athena-hack-2022/) and its current members are [Jason Clifton](https://github.com/JasonClifton), [Joss Konrad-Lee](https://github.com/jkonradlee), [Linda GÃ¼ster](https://github.com/xViolaine), [Wrin Langford](https://github.com/WrinLangford) and [Zan Clifton](https://github.com/ZanClifton). 

## Athena Hackathon 2022

Our first hackathon as a team. Jason and Wrin created the API and provided some support on the frontend, Zan and Linda worked entirely on the frontend. It was a very frontend heavy project. Joss provided copy for both the website and created the presentation, whilst courageously battling with covid.

### Project Theme
![For our challenge, we want you to build something that could play a part in helping displaced people or refugees across the world get access to new skills, work and/or career opportunities. There are a number of challenges that refugees face when needing to gain access to opportunities. This tool could tackle a number of problems, such as matching skills to opportunities, matching people to learning or retraining opportunities, or matching people to support (e.g. shelter, food, medicine, clothing, IT equipment).](https://github.com/snack-overflow-athena-hackathon/.github/blob/main/images/beamery2022theme.png)

### Judges' Feedback
![We appreciate the creativity, determination and hard work that has gone into completing your project and our sponsors were truly amazed by your ideas and level of skill. Really cool and different take on the brief (pets are super important!) and Snack Overflow is a great name! Really great job on the UI in such a short amount of time - what would have maybe been nice in the presentation would have been some more research/stats to help give some context to the app - great job overall though!](https://github.com/snack-overflow-athena-hackathon/.github/blob/main/images/beamery2022feedback.png)
